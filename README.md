Inspired by AirBnB, ezStay is a full-stack web application. The application was built with Ruby on Rails, React, and Redux.
New users are given the option to sign up, and returning users can log in. Users are also given the option to log in as a guest. Users can explore the locations available and see more information about individual locations. When logged in, users are given the option to host their own homes and write reviews about other locations.

## Features

### Hosting a Location

When signed in, users are allowed to host their own homes and create a page for the home by inputting a title, description, the district it is located, address, cancellation policy, price, number of guests, rooms, beds, and bathrooms.

### Explore Locations

On the explore location page users are able to see all available locations. Implementing a search via Google maps and search bar will be done in the future. If a user clicks on a location they will be redirected to the specific location's main page.

### Single Location

Users are able to view a specific location and see the image, title, description, amenities, and all reviews for the location. Users are also able to write their own review if they are logged in.

### Reviews

Users are able to write a review at locations they have stayed at. All reviews for specific locations are visible at the bottom of the page showing the first name of the user who wrote the review, the title, and description.
