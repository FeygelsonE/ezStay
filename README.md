Inspired by AirBnB, ezStay is a full-stack web application. The application was built with Ruby on Rails, React, and Redux.

## Features

When signed in, users are allowed to host their own homes and create a page for the home by inputting a title, description, the district it is located, address, cancellation policy, price, number of guests, rooms, beds, and bathrooms.

### Explore Locations

On the explore location page users are able to see all available locations. Implementing a search via Google maps and search bar will be done in the future. If a user clicks on a location they will be redirected to the specific location's main page.

### Future Features

Implementing a way for users to book locations is the next feature to be added.
After bookings, implementing a search via address and Google Maps would make the site more complete.
A nice feature to add on top of those would be being apple to click on user profiles.
