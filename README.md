Inspired by AirBnB, ezStay is a full-stack web application. The application was built with Ruby on Rails, React, and Redux.
New users are given the option to sign up, and returning users can log in. Users are also given the option to log in as a guest. Users can explore the locations available and see more information about individual locations. When logged in, users are given the option to host their own homes and write reviews about other locations.
